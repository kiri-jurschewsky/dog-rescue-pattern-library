The buttons use our primary colours to draw attention and stand out. They all have individual purpose:

- The regular buttons are for main buttons cards and forms.
- The light buttons are for dark background areas and links.
- The ghost buttons shout be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image as well as buttons that are links to other websites to enlarge a card.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size'classes to make different sizes of buttons.
